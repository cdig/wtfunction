# WTFunction

A trash-REPL for animations. [http://wtfunction.surge.sh](http://wtfunction.surge.sh)

What's a trash REPL? It's a REPL, but like.. you design it with beer and laziness. Don't read the code.. oh god, sorry. But you can like.. use it to make the cool thing that you make. It's like using your heat gun to loosen the tight lid on a jar. Or it's like killing flies with pure Buddhist kindness. Okay, it's not like that.
